# PathNavigator
Keyboard-friendly path navigation in Windows

A couple of month ago I started a tiny program as a hobby that would let you to easily open new directories and navigate between them without moving your hand off your keyboard. It was an attempt to eliminate mouse in this process, yet making it real simple by giving auto-completion. Kind of like tab-completion in Bash, but now for Windows Explorer.
I’m using it every day, it works seamless and although it seems quite naive, but it has become a must-have in my toolbox (I can’t stress enough how much I loathe mouse !).

There’s a golden tip for using this program, and that combining it with Clover or XYPlorer which provide you with tabs. Whether you use Path navigator (or as I like to call it, Panvig) or not, I encourge you to download [Clover](http://ejie.me) or [XYPlorer](http://www.xyplorer.com/).
